1. Once "logged in" (if we can really call it logged in yet), the user is presented with a new
    activity. Pressing the logout button brings the user back to the login activity, but more needs
    to be done. There is an activity stack that will hold the "logged in activity" that should not
    be available once logged out.
    
2. A user needs a way of registering an account. There are currently two dummy accounts.

3. More artwork/ general appearance will be nice.
